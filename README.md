# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Explain the importance of requirement analysis.  
- Provide examples of key activities (gathering, modeling, validation, and prioritization).  
- Share best practices to prevent scope creep and ensure successful project outcomes.  

It will serve as a learning resource for students, developers, and project managers who want to strengthen their knowledge of requirement engineering.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

During this phase, project teams work closely with stakeholders, end-users, and business analysts to gather both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform).  

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
1. **Defines Project Scope** – Clearly outlines what will and will not be included in the system, preventing scope creep.  
2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment** – Helps ensure that all parties agree on the project goals and deliverables.  
3. **Guides Design and Development** – Provides a foundation for system design, coding, and testing.  
4. **Improves Resource Allocation** – By prioritizing requirements, resources (time, cost, effort) can be used effectively.  
5. **Reduces Errors and Rework** – Catching ambiguities and conflicts early avoids costly changes during later stages.  

In short, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between stakeholders' needs and the technical implementation, ensuring that the final software product delivers **real value** to users.

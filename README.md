# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Explain the importance of requirement analysis.  
- Provide examples of key activities (gathering, modeling, validation, and prioritization).  
- Share best practices to prevent scope creep and ensure successful project outcomes.  

It will serve as a learning resource for students, developers, and project managers who want to strengthen their knowledge of requirement engineering.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on identifying, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  

During this phase, project teams work closely with stakeholders, end-users, and business analysts to gather both **functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (how the system should perform).  

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
1. **Defines Project Scope** – Clearly outlines what will and will not be included in the system, preventing scope creep.  
2. **Ensures Stakeholder Alignment** – Helps ensure that all parties agree on the project goals and deliverables.  
3. **Guides Design and Development** – Provides a foundation for system design, coding, and testing.  
4. **Improves Resource Allocation** – By prioritizing requirements, resources (time, cost, effort) can be used effectively.  
5. **Reduces Errors and Rework** – Catching ambiguities and conflicts early avoids costly changes during later stages.  

In short, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between stakeholders' needs and the technical implementation, ensuring that the final software product delivers **real value** to users.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a **critical step** in the SDLC because it sets the foundation for the entire project. Without well-defined and validated requirements, the chances of failure increase significantly.  

Here are three key reasons why it is important:  

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**  
   By clearly defining the project boundaries and requirements early on, it helps avoid uncontrolled changes or additions later in the development process.  

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Identifying and resolving ambiguities or conflicts in requirements at the beginning reduces expensive rework, delays, and budget overruns in later stages.  

3. **Ensures Stakeholder Satisfaction**  
   Proper requirement analysis ensures that the final product meets the actual needs of end-users and stakeholders, increasing the likelihood of project success.  

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The Requirement Analysis process involves several structured activities to ensure clarity and accuracy of requirements. The five key activities are:  

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information about the system from stakeholders, end-users, and business documents to understand their needs and expectations.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Engaging with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and brainstorming sessions to uncover hidden or implicit requirements.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording the gathered requirements in a clear, structured format (such as Software Requirement Specification – SRS) to provide a reference for development and testing.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, and representing them using models like use-case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or process flows.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, feasible, and aligned with business objectives before moving to design and development.

  ## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They specify the features, behaviors, and operations of the software.  

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- The system must allow users to **create, view, update, and cancel bookings**.  
- The system must send **email and SMS confirmations** after a booking is successfully made.  
- The system must allow administrators to **view booking reports** filtered by date, location, and customer.  
- The system must process **online payments** securely through multiple payment gateways.  

---

### Non-functional Requirements
**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**. They define quality attributes such as usability, performance, security, and reliability.  

**Examples for Booking Management Project:**  
- The system should be able to handle **at least 500 concurrent users** without performance degradation.  
- The booking confirmation email must be sent within **30 seconds** of completing a transaction.  
- The system should be available **99.9% of the time** to ensure reliability.  
- The system must comply with **GDPR standards** to protect user data privacy.  
- The user interface should be **mobile-responsive** and accessible according to **WCAG 2.1 standards**.

## Use Case Diagrams

**Definition:**  
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between different types of users (**actors**) and the system. It helps identify system functionalities (use cases) and illustrates how stakeholders will interact with them.  

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**  
- Provide a clear understanding of system scope and functionalities.  
- Help stakeholders and developers communicate effectively.  
- Serve as a foundation for creating detailed functional requirements.  

**Use Case Diagram for Booking Management System:**  

Actors:  
- **Customer** (creates and manages bookings)  
- **Administrator** (manages the system and reporting)  
- **Payment Gateway** (processes online payments)  

Use Cases:  
- Create Booking  
- Update/Cancel Booking  
- Receive Confirmation (Email/SMS)  
- Make Payment  
- View Reports (Admin only)





## Acceptance Criteria

**Definition:**  
Acceptance Criteria are the specific **conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders**. They provide clear, testable requirements that define the boundaries of a feature and help determine whether development work is complete.  

**Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis:**  
- Ensure a shared understanding between stakeholders and developers.  
- Provide measurable outcomes for validating features.  
- Reduce ambiguity by clarifying what "done" means for a requirement.  
- Guide the creation of test cases for Quality Assurance.  

**Example – Checkout Feature in Booking Management System:**  

*Acceptance Criteria:*  
1. The system must display a booking summary before checkout.  
2. The user must be able to select a preferred payment method (credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer).  
3. Payment processing must be secure and comply with PCI-DSS standards.  
4. Upon successful payment, the system must generate a booking confirmation with a unique reference number.  
5. The system must send confirmation via email and SMS within 30 seconds of payment completion.  
6. If payment fails, the user must be notified with an appropriate error message and given the option to retry.
